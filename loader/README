BootMii Loader
Copyright (c) 2023, nitr8

BootMii Loader is just what it's name tells.

It basically runs from within MEM1 and creates
a new ARMBOOT binary which is required to run
BootMii successfully using NANDBoot and the
SystemMenu on a regular Wii.

Using NANDBoot, BootMii Loader allows to run
BootMii on ANY Wii - no matter if that Wii has
a vulnerable boot2 or not...
