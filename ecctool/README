ECC tool just adds the required ECC data to
whatever file is given as input and it will
output to a new file which es up to the user input.

The new file will have the size of 1 block of NAND
as long as the binary data given as input fits
within 131072 bytes. Anything else will make use of
an additional NAND block.
